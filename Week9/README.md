This project is a Python script that implements a Pomodoro timer, which is a time management method that alternates work and break periods. The Pomodoro technique is designed to improve productivity and focus by breaking down tasks into manageable chunks and avoiding distractions.

The script can be run from the command line with different options to specify the duration of work or break periods, or use the default values of 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for break. The script accepts the following arguments:

- `-t` followed by an integer to set the work period in minutes
- `-b` followed by an integer to set the break period in minutes
- `-h` to display the help message

The script uses the `time.perf_counter()` function from the `time` module to measure the elapsed time and update the screen every second with a countdown and a progress bar. The countdown shows the remaining minutes and seconds, while the progress bar shows how much of the current period has been completed using üçÖ and ‚Äì symbols.

The script also uses the `subprocess.Popen()` function from the `subprocess` module to send notification messages when the time is up, depending on the operating system. The notification messages can be customized by passing them as arguments to the `tomato()` function, which takes two parameters: minutes and notify_msg. The script supports three types of notifications:

- For Linux systems, it uses the `notify-send` command with üçÖ as icon
- ...

The script can be interrupted at any time by pressing Ctrl+C, which will print a goodbye message and exit gracefully.
